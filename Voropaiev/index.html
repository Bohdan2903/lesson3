        Stephen R. Covey’s The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People is a staple amongst the productivity genre of
        self-help books. It was written over 30 years ago, yet it remains a best seller, often handed out at offsites or
        during company onboardings. The key to its success is not just the raw content, but the framework that Stephen
        uses to present the information:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li class="list disabled"><a href="#">Habit 1: Be proactive</a></li>
        <li class="list"><a href="#">Habit 2: Begin with the end in mind</a></li>
        <li class="list visited"><a href="#">Habit 3: Put first things first</a></li>
        <li class="list"><a href="#">Habit 4: Think win-win</a></li>
        <li class="list"><a href="#">Habit 5: Seek first to understand, then to be understood</a></li>
        <li class="list uppercase"><a href="#">Habit 6: Synergize</a></li>
        <li class="list"><a href="#">Habit 7: Sharpen the saw</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p class="paragraph styleparagraph">
        The habits flow from one to the next. The first three are about taking responsibility and aligning your life to
        achieve your goals. The next three are about effectively working with other people. And the final habit is about
        the sustainability of your life in pursuit of those goals.
    </p>
    <h3 class="subtitle">
        While this framework is great, I read this book ten years ago, and I struggle to remember all seven habits.
    </h3>
    <p class="paragraph">
        You know what I can remember? Vivid details from Game of Thrones, and I first read that book over 15 years ago.
        If you are the type of person that can remember half the episodes of The Office but struggle to remember a
        self-help book, then this post is for you.
    </p>
    <h3 class="subtitle">
        My intent with this post is to use Tyrion Lannister as a mnemonic device to help you to better remember the
        seven habits.
    </h3>
    <p class="paragraph">
        If you haven’t read or watched Game of Thrones, I don’t recommend reading this post, as there are spoilers
        ahead. With that being said, here’s a brief reminder of who Tyrion is.
